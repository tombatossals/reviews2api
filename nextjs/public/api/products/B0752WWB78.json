There’s also a pocket for your phone or keys!Con: the space that you have to fit your head through is EXTREMELY small with no stretch. Your head has to go through the first hole and go around your neck so that the costume can inflate. You can’t cut it or else it won’t work. I have locs (attached a second photo for reference) and we struggled to get my head and hair through the first hole. We ended up putting my hair in a high ponytail at the very top of my head and pulling the ponytail through FIRST instead of trying to pull it down over my hair. The pull down method did not work. There was no stretch. Once I got my hair through the hole I was able to slide it down with no problem. Well, it was still a little tight but with help we got it on!Overall great costume for the cost. Just be aware that if you have big hair, braids, locs etc you’ll have to do some maneuvering to get your head through the tiny hole. Worth it though for the laughs."

You basically have to put your head through both holes then move back through the outermost one so the lining. Goes under your chin and above your head.

The only reason I'm giving this costume a 3 star is because we returned it once because the zipper fell apart. The costume can't hold it air when the zipper isn't able to zip up properly. This happen the first time we were took the costume off. Thankfully this happened before Halloween. We exchanged the item for the exact same costume. We thought the first was just a defect. The night of Halloween we all got dressed up the costume was a hoot for all. Unfortunately- the exact same problem happened again! It was the first time I was helping him out of his costume. My husband is not a big man at all. He's 6'1 and 180lbs. I would recommend the manufacturer to use better zippers than the cheap ones they are using. Because now we aren't able to use the costume again. It was a one time wear deal, which is really unfortunate- especially because of the price we spent on it. Overall it was a fun time, but worth letting the next person know exactly what they are purchasing."

In the end he couldn't actually wear it because his head wouldn't fit through the head hole which we understood would be small due to holding in the air but it could have been elasticated similar to arms and legs but no. If we tried any harder to get his head through it would have ripped and he has quite a small head. Doesn't really look as good as the pictures and just overall very disappointed."

Based off fit, we wouldn't order again and I would say you shouldn't either if you are over >= 6'. Or if you consider your build athletic to big, I wouldn't order either. It looks like the sleeve/shoulder area is very tight and the elastic is stretched vey tight around his arms.  In addition, there are two holes in the head area. One is for your face, the other is inside and goes around the neck to seal in air. The neck hole is elastic with velcro, but my brother had to tear it a bit to fit over his head. It will seal enough to mostly allow inflation, but the dinosaur head will dip as it doesn't \"pressurize\" enough.  We think if he uses tape to seal the small tear it will fully inflate (shown in pic holding tear closed)."

There is also a nice pocket inside to hold the battery pack. One big downfall is that the opening for the head is VERY small. It would not go over either my 13-year old or 16-year old's heads... and yes, I opened the velcro."
