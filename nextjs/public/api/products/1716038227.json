The book is not well constructed, the layout is basic and has a discount store ¬£5 feel about it. The print is oversized and space hogging. Unfortunately the photographers prospective is poor and the images have a low resolution quality, feeling like they were pulled from the net. Images are not a nice high quality gloss  but a low quality mat finish.  Imho ¬£5 would be reasonable for this book but at ¬£21 I felt extremely had.The above is only my opinion and may not be shared by others."

The photos are on a poor quality flat mat paper . The worst thing about the photos is they are out of focus and blurry . This is not the right book to purchase if you are looking for nice glossy high quality pictures . This is not a coffee table book that I will want to pick up and breeze through the pages over and over again . More of a one and done read ."

It IS marketed as a beginners guide, and is only 76 pages long. All in all, it will be a good conversation piece so I'll put it on my bookshelf."

      "review": "This book is horrible. I seriously thought it was a joke at first. Let me count the ways:1) The layout.  This bothered me the most, actually.  It's laid out like a cheap children's book. Poorly focused pictures on one side with some large text set to a bright background on the other side.  It seriously looks like a book you read at your children's pediatricians office about going to the doctor.2) The content. It was poorly written,  confusing at best. It felt very unedited.  Like a bad blog post, not a book. Speaking of blogs, there was nothing here that isn't easily a Google search away.  No special tips to make this book special. No helpful pictures or diagrams.  The pictures for reference are black and white and are less than helpful.  I would actually recommend not looking at this book, as it will only confuse you more.3) Last, but not least,  the price. 20 bucks. 20 fricking dollars. Honestly,  if it was 5.99, I wouldn't be writing this review.  I would be like, ok, nice effort.  But for 20 dollars I feel like this is literally a scam. No joke.  I think someone copied some stuff off the internet,  put a fancy picture on the front,  and is trying to make money off of a current fad.This book actually made me NOT want to try CannaBonsai.  I threw away this book, and will not be attempting a bonsai. The feeling of being ripped off has left me uninterested in the hobby. If the writer of the book reads this, and it's not a money making prank, I want to say, please stop selling this monstrosity of a book. You need to do a lot more work, 8r seriously change your price point.DO NOT BUY!!!"
