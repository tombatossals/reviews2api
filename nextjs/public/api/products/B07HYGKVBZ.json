This house contains 3 adults aged 26, 35 and 67 and we all love it. We leave it in different areas of the house for each other to find. Best purchase of 2023!"

I met the postman at the end of the drive and quickly unwrapped this with the unbridled eagerness of a morbidly obese toddler who's finally got his/her bulky fingers on those precious Easter eggs. At first, I just placed it around the house and in the kids' beds for cheap screams and giggles. It's especially effective if you microwave it for 30 seconds to get it to a freshly laid temperature. The missus soon got tired of finding it in the bread bin, so I visited my parents and placed the bogus log on the carpet next to their old spaniel's dog bed, making sure that the eyes were out of site. Kipper, the dog, barely gave it a glance, but when my dad entered the room with a brew, his eyes were instantly drawn to the play poop. It worked a treat: he threw down the brew and picked poor Kipper up by the collar. I thought he was going to put his boot through his neck, but when he rubbed his face into the carpet he got a pleasant surprise when the poop didn't smudge, & just rolled across the carpet. He turned to me and we just laughed. Even Kipper took more interest in it when he finally came from under the table 1 hr later. Great fun!"

The (for brevity lets just call it \"poop\") poop has an almost damp feel and floppy quality. Anyone who has had a dog, children or not owned a toilet plunger in an emergency could probably attest to the realistic nature of this stress toy.I am now in trouble for wrapping the toy in a tissue, throwing it at my dad and saying, \"You left the blo*dy dog locked in my bedroom and she pooped on the floor. You deal with it!\" . My father didn't find it very amusing and used many short, unpublishable words to express his anger. Perhaps this product should come with a warning that not everybody has a sense of humour about faeces.On the plus side, the NHS could use the toy as an illustrative (s)tool; If your faeces looks markedly different to this, ask your GP or nurse about dietary changes you might want to make.NB. Your poop need not contain eyes. See a parasitologist if you notice eyes or teeth in your stools.I am considering buying another."
